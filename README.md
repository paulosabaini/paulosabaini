Ciao ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Paulo, a Mobile developer with a passion for creating native and cross-platform apps using Kotlin and Flutter. I have experience working on projects for various sectors, such as banking, telecom, and coffee. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. 

I enjoy reading books, listening to rock and roll music, cooking delicious meals, watching movies, learning new things, and playing video games in my spare time. I have Italian roots and Iâ€™m fascinated by the culture and history of Italy.
